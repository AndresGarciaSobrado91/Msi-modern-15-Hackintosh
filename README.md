Opencore &amp; clover EFI (soon) 

This is my WIP Opencore EFI folder

My config:
Core i5 10210u
pm981a (windows)
sabrent 1To (macos)
realtek ALC233 (seeing at alc235)
8go ram samsung

What works:
graphics acceleration
keyboard with brightness keys
trackpad with gesture (sometimes doesn't works seems AppleALC the culprit)
bluetooth (intel) works sometimes

What doesn't works:
Cnvi intel wlan

Sound (need more investigation)
